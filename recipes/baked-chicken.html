    <h4>Baked Chicken</h4>
    <p>
      If there is one recipe that every home cook should know, it's this baked
      chicken recipe. All you need is chicken, olive oil, salt, and pepper (and
      maybe some stock or white wine for gravy).
    </p>
    <p>
      This way of cooking chicken couldn't be more straightforward. It's
      especially welcome on days when you're busy and just want to put good food
      on the table.
    </p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 (3 to 4 pound) chicken, cut into 8 parts (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs,
        2 wings), excluding the back
      </li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock or white wine for the gravy, (optional)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a
        paper towel. Sprinkle all sides with salt. Let the chicken pieces sit
        for 15 to 20 minutes to take the chill off.
      </li>

      <li>Set the oven to 400°F (205°C).</li>

      <li>
        Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Rub olive oil all over
        the chicken pieces and on the bottom of the roasting pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sprinkle the chicken pieces all over with black pepper and a little more
        salt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Arrange the chicken pieces in the pan, so that all the pieces are
        skin-side up, and the largest pieces (the breasts) are in the center of
        the pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        Don't crowd the pan. Allow room in between the pieces for the heat to
        circulate. Bake (uncovered) in the oven for 30 minutes at 400°F (205°C).
        This initial high heat will help brown the chicken.
      </li>

      <li>
        Then, lower the heat to 350°F (175°C) and bake for an additional 10 to
        30 minutes until the juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp
        knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165°F
        (74°C), and of the thighs is 170°F (77°C) when tested with a meat
        thermometer.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove from oven and transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Tent with
        aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you would like to make gravy with the drippings from the chicken,
        place the roasting pan with all its drippings on the stove top and set
        the burner to medium heat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a metal spatula to scrape up the stuck drippings from the bottom of
        the pan. When the pan is hot, pour in some white wine or chicken stock
        to help loosen the drippings from the pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer the drippings and stock/wine mixture to a saucepan and heat on
        medium high until reduced to your desired thickness.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you want the gravy even thicker, you can make a slurry with a little
        cornstarch or flour (a teaspoon) and water (1/4 cup), and add that to
        the gravy while it cooks. Enjoy!
