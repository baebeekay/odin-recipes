    <h4>Nigerian Pancake</h4>
    <p> Nigerian Pancake is quite different from the regular pancake. It is actually the french version of pancake
        (crepes) personalized to suit our Nigerian taste buds</p>
    <p>The ingredients consist mainly of sugar, pepper and onion, which gives the pancake a sweet, slightly spicy and
        savoury taste, that will keep you asking for more.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> 190 gr Plain Flour</li>
        <li>2 raw Eggs</li>
        <li> 200ml whole milk OR evaporated milk OR 3tablesponful powdered milk in water</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoonful Butter/margarine (melted) or vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 4 tablespoonful Sugar(more or less)</li>
        <li> Chilli pepper or Scotch bonnet(atarodo) (to taste)</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoonful Onions (minced)(to taste)</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li> A pinch of Nutmeg(optional)</li>
        <li> 1-2 tablespoonful vegetable oil (for greasing the pan)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Break the eggs into a wide bowl, add the melted butter and sugar; Cream(mix) together using a whisk or
            wooden spatula.</li>

        <li> Add the minced onions, pepper, salt, nutmeg and the milk. Whisk Thoroughly.</li>

        <li> Gradually add the flour and keep on whisking. The mixture would begin to thicken and look lumpy.</li>

        <li> Add more milk or water if the pancake batter is too thick and continue stirring until the pancake batter is
            smooth with a runny consistency.</li>
        <li> Place a little oil on a pan (preferable a non-stick pan), spread the oil with a brush to grease the whole
            surface and heat up until hot.</li>

        <li> Using a ladle(soup spoon), scoop up some of the pancake batter and pour into the hot pan.
            Gently tilt the pan, so that the batter can evenly coat the surface of the pan.</li>

        <li> Cook one side of the pancake for a few seconds, then flip over and cook the other side. Enjoy!.</li>
